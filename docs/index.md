# PBH-{math}`\beta`

`PBHbeta` is a Python library for **computing abundances of primordial black holes 
(PBHs) in Early Universe.** 


```{warning}
This project is under heavy development.
```

## Requeriments

1. **Python 3.6 or later:** The betaPBH library requires Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.

```{note}
This code runs both in Python 3x. However, we highly recommend Python 3.9. The GitHub repository and PyPI package for betaPBH provide the necessary libraries to run the software. However, these dependencies must be imported into your notebook or console for the functions to be available.
```

2. **pip package manager:** The pip package manager is used to install betaPBH and its dependencies. It should be included with your Python installation by default.

3. **NumPy and SciPy libraries:** The NumPy and SciPy libraries are required by betaPBH and can be installed using pip. These libraries provide support for numerical computations and scientific computing in Python.

4. **Matplotlib library:** The Matplotlib library is also required by betaPBH and can be installed using pip. This library provides support for creating various types of charts and graphs in Python.
